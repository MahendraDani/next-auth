# NextAuth

> Why are the next-auth docs such a mess? They really need to step up.

This repo contains my learnings and use of next-auth. I know using kinde, clerk or any other service for that matter is easier but it's always better to have your app's authentication system in-house and next-auth gives you that! (At the cost of you getting overwhelmed by their confusing docs)

## What's done

1. Authentication using _Email Provider_ with custom signin page and form (all power is in my hands now xd)
2. Verify-request page when magic link request is send

## TODO

1. Error handling when email is not sent
2. Zod validation in user input
3. Client side error handling
4. Role-based auth (I am really bored with doing this now! Really don't want to developer another platform man! But what can I do? Honor calls!)
5. Play with more nextauth options
